                Reproducing the way an acoustic drum behaves when struck is a key factor in the playability of electronic drums. Our electronic drums feature a sound module that covers the full range of sound from the initial attack to the final cutoff, all based on samples of authentic drums tuned by a skilled engineer. We have carried out exhaustive testing of how acoustic drums respond when they’re hit to help achieve a truly faithful representation of drum behavior. Moreover, professional drummers from around the world have evaluated the performance of the DTX-PRO, allowing us to improve its expressive capabilities even further. The wealth of expertise we have acquired as a manufacturer of music hardware has allowed us to offer combinations of expertly-crafted modules and pads that deliver superb playability.
