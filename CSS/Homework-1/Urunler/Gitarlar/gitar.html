                A truly special "Special Edition" instrument, this 414ce V-Class Grand Auditorium acoustic-electric features many custom elements artfully incorporated by Taylor Guitars' Master Guitar Designer, Andy Powers. Along with Taylor's innovative V-Class bracing, together, these features deliver much more than the sum of their parts. For everyone from pros to hobbyists, they make the playing experience more expressive, inspiring and fun. The volume, the sustain, the "in-tune-ness" of the instrument and its high-fidelity sonic detail combine to deliver a new level of player experience. Indian rosewood is one of the most popular and musically expressive tonewoods in the world, and paired with Sitka spruce produces a rich and detailed sound. Taylor's Grand Auditorium shape and rosewood's balanced, broad sonic range and complexity—and of course Taylor's renown playability—result in a guitar that will be a joy to play in a variety of scenarios for a lifetime.

                The SG Bass has the legendary looks, sound and feel which made it one of Gibson's most iconic basses. The short scale length is actually a big part of this sound! While the short scale length of the SG Bass is preferred by smaller players, it's also preferred by many for the strong fundamental tone for which this short scale bass is known. As expected, the solid mahogany body has deeply sculpted scarfing and the rounded profile mahogany neck and rosewood fingerboard feels familiar and comfortable. A pair of calibrated SG bass pickups (neck and bridge) with individual volume and master tone controls add further tonal possibilities.
