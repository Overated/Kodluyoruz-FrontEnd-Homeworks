It has a solid lutz spruce top with layered sapele back and sides, and genuine African ebony for the fingerboard and bridge. It also features a simplified armrest for increased comfort. Amplify your sound with Taylor ES-B electronics, which incorporate piezo design elements from the flagship ES2 system. Powered by a 9V battery, its onboard preamp includes a built-in digital chromatic tuner, an LED display for tuning and low battery indication, and a tone-sculpting 3-band EQ.

                A truly special "Special Edition" instrument, this 414ce V-Class Grand Auditorium acoustic-electric features many custom elements artfully incorporated by Taylor Guitars' Master Guitar Designer, Andy Powers. Along with Taylor's innovative V-Class bracing, together, these features deliver much more than the sum of their parts. For everyone from pros to hobbyists, they make the playing experience more expressive, inspiring and fun. The volume, the sustain, the "in-tune-ness" of the instrument and its high-fidelity sonic detail combine to deliver a new level of player experience. Indian rosewood is one of the most popular and musically expressive tonewoods in the world, and paired with Sitka spruce produces a rich and detailed sound. Taylor's Grand Auditorium shape and rosewood's balanced, broad sonic range and complexity—and of course Taylor's renown playability—result in a guitar that will be a joy to play in a variety of scenarios for a lifetime.
