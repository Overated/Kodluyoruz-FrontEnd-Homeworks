                    <strong>Altus Z-cut professional headjoint is responsive and clear</strong><br>
                    Azumi flutes are distinguished by the inclusion of the Altus Z-cut professional headjoint. Responsive and free blowing, the Altus Z-cut headjoint features a rectangular-shaped embouchure hole, which improves articulation and allows your flute to sing sweetly in all registers. Carefully crafted by Altus, this handmade headjoint is included with every Azumi flute. The Altus Z-cut headjoint’s clear, open tone makes it a natural choice for symphonic settings, while its remarkable responsiveness will appeal to jazz players and flutists performing in other contemporary styles.

                    <strong>Altus-Bennett Scale provides exceptional intonation</strong><br>
                    Another commonality between all Azumi flutes is the use of the Altus-Bennett scale. A collaboration between Altus flutemaker Shuichi Tanaka and renowned British flutist William Bennett, the Altus-Bennett scale is a modified version of the Cooper scale, which was adopted by most major flute manufacturers to replace the Boehm system. The Altus-Bennett scale expands on the Cooper system to create flutes that exhibit exceptional intonation, carefully tuned harmonics, and balanced registers. Not only will you benefit from improved intonation, but you’ll also be treated to an effortless playing experience along with a tone boasting incredible depth, color, and clarity.

                    Founded by musician, engineer, and master flute maker Shuichi Tanaka, Altus has provided the music world with brilliantly conceived and exquisitely constructed instruments that merge traditional artistry with modern innovation. Made by Altus, Azumi flutes are designed by Tanaka to provide serious student musicians and aspiring artists with professional-class features at an affordable price. Azumi flutes share many attributes with Altus’s handcrafted flutes, including the Altus Z-cut professional headjoint, the Altus-Bennett scale, and elegant pointed key arms, making them a step-up flute of choice for music educators.

                Inheriting the many merits of top-of-the-line Yamaha handmade flutes, these models offer rich, nuanced tonality over a wide dynamic range. The 500 and 600 series combine the brightness of nickel silver with the characteristic mellow timbres of sterling silver, while the 700 series delivers warmth and expressive colour that only the finest silver flutes can provide. All models come with Type Am headjoints based on the Type A headjoints supplied with handmade flutes 900 and 800 series. The keys feature traditional pointed key arms, reflecting the highest level of craftsmanship and adding visual elegance to these outstanding instruments.
            </p>
            <p class="product-info">
             <strong>Type Am Headjoint</strong><br>
             Based on the Handmade Flute’s Type A design, which offers a wider expressive range, the Type Am headjoint additionally offers easier response and excellent balance over the instrument’s entire range, slightly heavier resistance, and a wide dynamic range.

            <p class="product-info">
                <strong>Straubinger Phoenix™ Pads (YFL-700/600)</strong><br>
                Straubinger Phoenix™ Pads offer the same concept as Straubinger™ Pads on our Handmade Flute, and have more suitable design for 700/600 series. The pads offer softer touch, but also superior response, wide dynamic range and tolerance of environmental changes same as Straubinger™ Pads.

            <p class="product-info">
                <strong>Heavy Wall Thickness (YFL-700/600)</strong><br>
                The thickness of the wall has been increased from 0.38mm to 0.43mm to improve balance for use with the new Type Am headjoint and the Straubinger Phoenix™ Pads.
            </p>
            <p class="product-info">
                <strong>Sound Annealing</strong><br>
                A special annealing process delivers more pure transmission of vibration from the player to the flute for rich resonance and superior response.
            </p>
            <p class="product-info">
                <strong>Key Design</strong><br>
                The keys are hand-assembled and meticulously balanced for a perfect touch. And the key shapes have been so exquisitely designed and ergonomically placed that the flute will almost ‘disappear’ in your hands. Performances will feel effortlessly natural.
            </p>
            <p class="product-info">
                <strong>Pointed Key Arms</strong><br>

                <strong>Case</strong><br>
                The case is compact for easy travel and durable to protect the flute, and is accompanied by a sophisticated case cover.
