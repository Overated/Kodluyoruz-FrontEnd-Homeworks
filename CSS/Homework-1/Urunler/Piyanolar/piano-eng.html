By 1990, the Bluthner family resumed control and built new facilities just outside Leipzig in 1997.

                These aren’t just baby grands. They’re our babies. Yamaha designers, engineers and craftsmen were challenged to bring out the expressive tone, subtle colors and dynamics of a conservatory grand from a more compact instrument. The GB1K and GC Series put the unmistakable sound of a Yamaha grand piano in more places, and in reach of more people, than ever before.

                <strong>Take the Stage</strong><br>
                RD pianos have been the choice of professional keyboardists for more than 30 years, appearing on stages around the world. Now you can have the acclaimed RD sound and playability in a lighter, more accessible, and more affordable instrument.
            </p>
            <p class="product-info">
                <strong>World-class playability</strong><br>
                For over three decades, RD pianos have been trusted by professionals, night after night, on stages the world over. One key reason is how playable they are, and how connected you feel when you play one. You get sturdy controls and smooth, reliable keyboard action that feels natural—never stiff, never spongy.
            </p>
            <p class="product-info">
                <strong>Authentic sounds</strong><br>
                A great stage piano needs sounds that are authentic and have character. The RD-88 draws upon its rich heritage and features newly developed SuperNATURAL pianos and electric pianos that can go from sparkle to grit with a few knob twists. And for extra versatility, there's a curated selection of acoustic and electronic sounds from our historic legacy using the ZEN-Core Synthesis System found in our flagship synthesizers.
            </p>
            <p class="product-info">
                <strong>Refreshingly simple</strong><br>
                RD pianos are easy to connect with, thanks to their intuitive controls and friendly layout. The RD-88 is no different, giving you just what you need for confident and expressive performances. Vital controls are clearly marked and always in reach, so you can quickly find your favorite sounds, add effects, or shape the tonal balance to suit the venue.
            </p>
            <p class="product-info">
                <strong>Integrate soft synths</strong><br>
                Sometimes you need a very specific sound or the unique capabilities of a particular soft synth or sample library. The RD-88 has three zones that can be configured with internal sounds, or can integrate and control soft synths from Apple MainStage. This makes it simple to duplicate the sound of a track live or mix favorite soft synths with the RD-88's own palette of sounds.
            </p>
            <p class="product-info">
                <strong>Fits your life</strong><br>
                The RD-88's clean and compact design fits neatly into your lifestyle. Its lightweight and sturdy build makes it easy to take with you and quick to set up, even on small stages or in cramped rehearsal spaces. And the room-filling integrated speaker system is ultra-convenient and lets you play with less clutter and less fuss.

                <strong>Evolution of a Modern Classic</strong><br>
                Never before has a single instrument captured the signature sound, the unique performance experience, and the aesthetic satisfaction of so many definitive keyboards as the KORG SV-2 Stage Vintage. Ten years ago, KORG launched the Stage Vintage line to wild acclaim. The combination of an intuitive live panel, the premier keybed, the ultimate realization of coveted vintage sounds, the clarity of world-class pianos, the warmth and character of period-proper effects, and the distinctively smooth shape has inspired musicians from around the globe for over a decade. Available with either 88 keys or 73 keys, these SV-2 models are the latest additions to the Stage Vintage series, featuring more of everything that makes an SV great. More Sounds. More Memory. More Polyphony. More Presets. More Control. It is quite literally everything one could want in a performance stage piano … and more. Plus, be sure to check out the SV-2S models, equipped with an internal K-ARRAY speaker system.
            </p>
            <p class="product-info">
                <strong>More. More. More.</strong><br>
                The SV-2 contains over ten times the sample data available in previous SV models, providing ample memory for many all-new piano and keyboard sounds. The SV-2 is home to 72 compelling sounds, and provides 64 memory locations to store edited Favorites for instant access during performance. Using the SV-2 Editor software, users are now free to create their own split and layered programs and save them to one of the Favorites locations. In fact, a single favorite can access up to three timbres at once – A piano/bass split with a layer of strings, for example. While user splits must be created using the SV-2 Editor, the split point on the keyboard can be adjusted directly from the front panel. Plus, polyphony of the SV-2 now stands at 128 voices, allowing more effective layering of sounds or sustained chording
            </p>
            <p class="product-info">
                <strong>Faithful Sound Reproduction</strong><br>
                The SV-2 represents the pinnacle of audio sampling techniques and careful instrument preparation, delivering the most exacting and accurate rendition of so many keyboard classics. Using only the best-maintained instruments and the latest multi-mic’ing methods, every sound has been captured as precisely as possible. The slap of the tine, the release of the hammer, the click of the contacts—every element is amazingly preserved in the RX Layer; mix in as much or as little of these authentic artifacts as you need. In addition, the full dynamic range of each instrument has been faithfully preserved, recreating all of the timbral and volume changes generated from a ppp (pianississimo) touch to an fff (fortississimo) strike – and everything in between. This detailed sampling regime creates a three-dimensional sense of presence, allowing the sound to fully occupy its place in the mix or in the performance space.
            </p>
            <p class="product-info">
                <strong>Coveted Classics</strong><br>
                Experience a treasure trove of classic electro-mechanical, transistorized, tape-driven, analog, and digital keyboard instruments, all reproduced with stunning realism. These sounds defined decades of popular music, and are now once again in demand. The SV-2 places all of these sought-after sounds right at the fingertips – in perfect tune and in impeccable playing condition – no maintenance required. It’s all here. Electric pianos now include nearly all the American tine and reed models, a Japanese electric grand, as well as a rare German electric piano. And then there all those clavis, created using a range of settings. Prefer electronic pianos? There are analog, digital, VPM, FM, and sampled versions – including the ever-popular KORG M1 piano. Looking for Organs? Select from tone-wheel classics; VOX combo, Italian transistor, or American tube organs; and now church and cathedral organs. Need some strings? Choose from a 70s-era analog string machine, prog-era tape strings, or a warm orchestral section. Plus, the SV-2 contains mallets, brass and choir sounds, guitar and bass sounds, even solo and pad synths that are ideal for layering or creating convenient splits.
            </p>
            <p class="product-info">
                <strong>Plenty of Pianos</strong><br>
                The SV-2 remains, at heart, a stage piano. At the touch of a button, you can summon the most outstanding grand piano sounds from around the world – including exemplary pianos from the leading German, Italian, Austrian, and Japanese instrument makers. For a more intimate setting, choose one of the authentic Japanese or German upright pianos. Also included are a real honky-tonk piano and a genuine “tack” piano. Last but not least, the SV-2 contains two gorgeous harpsichords, one French and one Italian. Featured alone, layered with another sound, or split across the keyboard, these outstanding piano sounds deliver a strong foundation while delivering additional performance options.
            </p>
            <p class="product-info">
                <strong>Seize Control</strong><br>
                The SV-2 invites you to take command of your sound. There is no LCD screen, no menus to dive through. Instantly inviting and familiar, the front panel is always live, so go ahead – grab a knob, rotate it, tweak it, and experiment. Change your mind? Pressing in on the knob quickly restores it to the programmed value. Switches with LED indicators show which effects are active, transposition, and more. Sounds are selected through a pair of rotary switches. Eight illuminated buttons in the center of the panel can quickly recall any of 64 Favorite presets, each containing your own customized sounds and settings. Best of all, the SV-2 now offers a Panel Lock function that prevents the accidental switching of sounds if the Favorites buttons are inadvertently touched while performing – and also prevents curious fingers from switching settings between sets. More detailed and convenient control is offered via the free SV-2 Editor software.
            </p>
            <p class="product-info">
                <strong>Agility and Expression</strong><br>
                All SV-2 Stage Vintage instruments share the finest KORG RH3 graded-hammer action keybed. As on a grand piano, the weighting of the keys is graduated across the keyboard; heavier in the lower registers and becoming lighter in the upper registers. This RH3 keybed is remarkably sensitive to the nuances of every performance, accurately delivering every expressive element. Selecting one of the eight distinct velocity curves allow the keyboard response to match any playing technique of performance style. Authentic to the end, the SV-2 offers eight tuning schemes including equal, grand piano stretch, electric piano stretch, electric grand, upright stretch, detuned and two user-definable types (configurable using the free SV-2 Editor). The overall tuning, or concert pitch, of the SV-2 can be adjusted to match another instrument or a previously recorded track. Needless to say, the SV-2 can be transposed into any key.

                <strong>Making it Real</strong><br>
                Adding the right effects provides layers of sonic splendor and adds a crowning level of authority to any vintage keyboard sound. The SV-2 features six independent stages of studio-grade signal processing, highlighted by the KORG Valve Reactor. This Valve Reactor circuit delivers the added warmth or snarl that only a true 12AX7A vacuum tube can provide. As with the sounds themselves, all of the effect models are faithful to the originals and are designed to match the performance, limitations, and behavior of the chosen effect. Easy to use and simple to control, these period-accurate effects and amp models add authenticity to your vintage and modern sonic pursuits. Effect stages include:

                <strong>Modern Connections</strong><br>
                The SV-2 is host to all the audio jacks, data connections, and pedal ports that today’s professional stage pianos require. In addition to the Left and Right 1/4" audio outputs, there are Left and Right XLR outputs for connecting directly to a studio console or onstage snake, without requiring any direct boxes or impedance matching transformers. The headphone output allows for onstage monitoring or for rehearsing in private. Din-style MIDI IN and MIDI Out jacks connect easily to other MIDI instruments and music equipment; the USB port provides a data link between the SV-2 and a computer.
                There are 3 pedal connections: Damper, Pedal 1, and Pedal 2. The DS-2H Damper pedal is included and responds to half-pedaling for an authentic piano response. Pedal 1 is designed for a switch type of pedal and can operate as a piano Sostenuto pedal, or as a Fast/Slow switch when the Rotary Pro effect is on. Pedal 2 can accept either a sweep-type pedal – great for authentic Wah effects and accurate organ volume control – or an additional switch pedal, providing the piano purist with access to all three piano pedal functions by adding the Una Chorda (soft) function.

            <p class="product-info">
                Designed for gigging keyboardists, the YC Series features a newly designed Virtual Circuitry Modeling (VCM) Organ engine with physical drawbars, extensive real-time control and authentic Acoustic/Electric Piano and FM synth sound. With three models to choose from, there’s a YC stage keyboard for every stage and every player.
            </p>
            <p class="product-info">
                <strong>SOUND</strong><br>
                When it comes to versatility, YC is a virtuoso. Featuring premium keyboard sound with more possibilities than ever. Choose from authentic Yamaha grand/upright pianos, electric pianos and keyboards to a tonewheel organ with rotary speaker, synths, acoustic sounds and more. Our proprietary VCM recreates the circuits of vintage analog EQs, compressors and phasers right down to the transistors and resistors to capture the subtleties other digital simulations can’t. It’s like having an incredible sounding keyboard with everything, to go.
            </p>
            <p class="product-info">
                <strong>VCM ORGAN</strong><br>
                How do you reproduce the warm, authentic sound of an organ in a stage keyboard? You build an organ engine the Yamaha way, from the ground up. Yamaha puts your favorite classic organ sounds in one powerful, stage keyboard. YC models three organ vintages - just out of the box, well-traveled and character-rich vintage. Need more? Go under the hood to adjust key click, leakage, rotary speaker speed and more to get the one-of-a-kind organ tone you've been searching for.
            </p>
            <p class="product-info">
                <strong>VCM ROTARY SPEAKER</strong><br>
                YC brings you the authentic sounds of classic rotary speakers with no maintenance required. Choose from two faithfully modeled rotary speaker profiles - warm and full or dirty and aggressive - and adjust top or bottom rotor speed for total control.<br>
                <strong>[New to OS v1.2]</strong><br>
                Based on your feedback, we’ve added a new “Studio” Rotary Speaker, featuring a wider stereo field, increased low rotor and high horn separation, as well as an increased presence to cut through mixes. VCM re-creates the sound and behavior of vintage effects and high-end studio signal processors by modeling the circuits down to the original analog component level.In 1983, Yamaha introduced the iconic sounds of FM (Frequency Modulation) synthesis to the world with the launch of the synthesizer DX7. Now YC brings FM synthesis to the organ for a new generation of players. Simply switch to FM Organ and your drawbars control 8 FM Operators that send a pure sound with massive low end. Add rotary speaker or amp sim effects for character and vibe. Intuitive controls make it easy to discover new sounds. Or recreate classic transistor organ tones from warm to reedy to buzzy by choosing one of three popular FM Organ modes. Helping to broaden your creativity are three new FM organ types – titled F4, F5, and F6. These delve deeper into FM synthesis by adding modulators – or operators – that add upper harmonics to carriers, yet do not sound. The user interface of drawbars, coupled with modulators, create vastly new approaches to the traditional drawbar organ experience, bringing the traditional drawbar concept into the 21st century.
            </p>
            <p class="product-info">
                <strong>TOUCH</strong><br>
                At Yamaha, we put everything we’ve learned over the last 100 years into everything you touch. Whether you prefer the natural feel of a graded acoustic piano, the balanced touch of an electric piano or a waterfall keyboard with authentic organ action, there’s a YC that’s right for you. It’s no wonder more players reach for Yamaha keyboards than any other.
            </p>
            <p class="product-info">
                <strong>YC61 WATERFALL KEYBOARD</strong><br>
                The authentic Waterfall keyboard action of the YC61 was created by painstaking research into traditional organ keyboards and constant feedback from top keyboard artists. The result is a keyboard that not only provides the distinctive touch of an organ, it gives artists new ways to express themselves on acoustic and electric pianos, synth leads, brass sections and more.
            </p>
            <p class="product-info">
                <strong>DESIGN</strong><br>
                YC Keyboards aren’t just designed to be played. They’re made to be bumped, jostled, scratched, crammed in a van, stuffed in an overhead bin and adored by players and fans, gig after gig. In short, they’re built to last, like the company that stands behind them.
            </p>
            <p class="product-info">
                <strong>DRAWBARS</strong><br>
                The nine drawbars on the YC have the footages and ratcheting you expect in an organ. But there’s more to our drawbars than meets the eye. See-through drawbar stops with customizable LED light color make it easy to see differences between simulated upper and lower configurations and play in split mode. It’s like having a virtual set of drawbars to give you more sounds, more flexibility and more choices than you ever thought possible in a stage keyboard.
            </p>
            <p class="product-info">
                <strong>DIRECT, IMMEDIATE AND TOTAL SOUND CONTROL</strong><br>
                YC is made for long jams, not long menus. The intuitive interface gives you fast and easy splits, layers and sound-shaping directly from the front panel. Proving that versatility doesn’t have to be complex.
            </p>
            <p class="product-info">
                <strong>MOBILITY</strong><br>
                YC61 weighs comes in at an incredible 7.1 kg. Which makes them compact and light enough for you to be your own roadie. But with a sound that players who can afford roadies will appreciate.
            </p>
            <p class="product-info">
                <strong>SOFT CASE</strong><br>
                Before you rock, roll. The optional YC soft case features a premium design and zippered compartments for storing pedals and other accessories.
            </p>
            <p class="product-info">
                <strong>COMPUTER/iOS</strong><br>
                YC features a built-in USB stereo audio and MIDI interface for Mac, PC and iOS devices. With a single USB cable, you can record the YC audio and MIDI to a DAW and play and monitor virtual instruments.

                    <strong>TONE</strong><br>
                    The DG30 digital grand piano captures the magnificent tone of Kawai’s flagship Shigeru Kawai SK-EX full concert grand piano. Widely regarded as the “premier pianos of Japan”, Shigeru Kawai instruments grace the stages of concert halls and musical institutions throughout the world, and are prized for their exceptional tonal clarity. In addition, the DG30 also features the distinctive sound of Kawai’s highly acclaimed EX concert grand piano, which has frequently been selected by professional pianists in such prestigious events as the Chopin, Tchaikovsky, and Rubinstein international piano competitions, among others. Both instruments have been carefully recorded, meticulously analysed, and faithfully reproduced with full 88-key sampling using Harmonic Imaging™ sound technology. This unique process accurately recreates the broad dynamic range of the original grand pianos, affording pianists an extraordinary level of expressiveness ranging from the softest pianissimo to the strongest, boldest fortissimo.

                The recorder on the DG30 allows up to three songs to be stored in internal memory and played back at the touch of a button. This functionality is expanded with 2-track recording that allows left and right-hand parts (or two different voices) to be recorded separately. Players can play back the left-hand part while practicing the right-hand part live—or vice versa—to strengthen hand independence.

                <strong>Commercial Use</strong><br>
                The grand piano is a refined and majestic instrument with a powerful and expressive tonal character. Its graceful appearance brings an air of classic elegance to any interior – whether at home or at a venue. And yet, although undeniably beautiful, owning an acoustic grand piano is not without challenges. Consider regular tuning and keyboard maintenance costs, as well as the considerable weight which makes it difficult to move around. The GP609 avoids these issues thanks to a variety of digital advantages that make it easy to enjoy a grand piano at a venue – or at home – without the cost or hassle.
