Bechstein Concert 8 upright has been improved and is now even more singing and enduring. Such outstanding characteristics explain why several great artists, including Simon & Garfunkel, Sir Simon Rattle and the Beatles, made this exceptional professional piano their favored working instrument. Ask your C. Bechstein dealer and find out about the finest-quality woods used for the piano parts and many other details that make up the exceptional quality of these top-class instruments. And if you visit the C. Bechstein production site, you’ll be fascinated as you discover the secrets of the making of the Concert 8, the “king of uprights”.

                Julius Bluthner established the Bluthner piano factory in 1853. Although he died in 1910, his 3 sons took over the company. During World War II, the factory was completely decimated and was rebuilt under national control of East Germany. By 1990, the Bluthner family resumed control and built new facilities just outside Leipzig in 1997.

                These aren’t just baby grands. They’re our babies. Yamaha designers, engineers and craftsmen were challenged to bring out the expressive tone, subtle colors and dynamics of a conservatory grand from a more compact instrument. The GB1K and GC Series put the unmistakable sound of a Yamaha grand piano in more places, and in reach of more people, than ever before.

                    The GB1K and GC Series pianos may be small, but they have a powerful resonance and tone that brings out the subtle nuances of every note.

                <em><strong id="SV200">Rich, resonant woods</strong></em>
                <li>
                    Great pianos start with the finest wood. Soundboards and ribs are crafted by Yamaha artisans using hand-selected spruce from our Kitami Wood Mill in Hokkaido, Japan.

                    These pianos share the robust back post design of our conservatory series pianos, giving them the powerful resonance, durability and tuning stability you might expect in a larger grand piano.
