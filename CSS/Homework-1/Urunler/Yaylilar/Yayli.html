                The Soil is strikingly handsome and this 1714 Stradivari has had more experience on the concert platform than almost any other violin. Played by Itzhak Perlman, the Soil is widely considered to be the best sounding Stradivari ever created. Other owners of this iconic instrument are French luthier and collector Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume and Yehudi Menuhin. The beauty of the violin is found in its extravagant maple wood figure which is illuminated and partly covered by Stradivari's greatest varnish.

                The GRGR120EX features poplar body with binding.

                Holstein German Virtuoso Violin (7.800$)

                <img class="product-pic" src="../../img/yaylilar/keman/keman2.webp" alt="keman2">
            </p>
            <p class="product-info">
                The story behind every Holstein German Virtuoso violin begins with quality selected tonewoods from the best regions of Bavaria, Austria, Switzerland, and Bosnia.  We start with wood that is over 30 years old, and dried and seasoned for an additional 30 years. These violins are handcrafted with the greatest attention to detail in our German workshop, which has over 25 years of experience making fine instruments. 
            </p>
            <p class="product-info">
                The Virtuoso violin is handmade by one master luthier from start to finish and raises the standard for affordable, handmade European instruments. While many shops are content to use German-sounding trade names for instruments not even made in Europe, the Holstein Virtuoso, named for our Founder and Fiddlerman himself, Pierre Holstein, represents an exciting new era of bringing the highest quality instruments from northern Bavaria to our global customer base.
            </p>
            <p class="product-info">
                The term "Virtuoso" refers to a person who is highly skilled as a musician or other artistic pursuits. They are often seen as possessing either an outstanding natural talent or advanced technical ability through years of hard work and dedication. 
            </p>
            <p class="product-info">
                The Holstein German Virtuoso is an excellent choice for any style and ability. The tone of each instrument is unique and generally produces exceptional tonal characteristics from very deep and profound low registers and brilliant and clear upper register.  With the power to fill an entire hall, and sensitive for even the most intimate of gatherings, the violin nimbly responds to the desires of the performer.

                    This is a very affordable electric violin, a good beginner violin kit, includes a case, composite bow, rosin, and 9V battery.The strings and the cable that come with it are cheap and are better replaced. The same can be said for the bow, which feels unbalanced and heavy. You’re better off with a carbon fiber one. However, these issues are all easily fixed. You do have to consider though that this will add to the overall price.

                <p class="product-info">
                    The only real thing I didn’t like was that it’s slightly on the heavy side. Not too much, but it can create issues with being able to play for extended periods.The sound is quite good for a budget electric violin, and overall this one is not a bad buy. It is also easily found all around the world.

                A new kind of electric violin taking its design inspiration from the organic beauty of wood, the simplicity of clean lines, and the comfort of light weight, combined with innovative Yamaha sound to create this gorgeous live-performance instrument. (5-string model)
            </p>
            <p class="product-info">
                Inspired by craft and design elements of Yamaha acoustic guitars, Yamaha set out to design a new kind of electric violin made primarily from wooden materials. This instrument takes a design cue from both violin and acoustic guitar shapes, creating a beautiful yet amazingly lightweight instrument made with six different woods. These wood materials are carefully crafted with an airy infinity loop-like design, representing the dimensions of acoustic space, and is as stunning visually as it is fun to play. Using a unique Yamaha bridge pickup that carries over from professional Yamaha Silent Violins, this instrument delivers a smooth, organic and warm tone. The design incorporates a simple ¼” input to match the clean and natural aesthetic of this innovative electric violin.

The varnish we use on our model 405 instruments emulates the exceptional varnishes from a century ago where a small number of master workshops in Markneukirchen, Germany distinguished themselves by developing some of the best varnishes of the modern era. The unique pickup system is embedded into the spruce top of the instrument before varnishing with no disturbance to the bridge. Our proprietary 3.5 mm jack is used as the end button on the violins and viola’s making it unnoticeable. Each Series+ instrument comes with a lightweight, low-profile cable that provides a seamless connection to your amplifier or individual playing setup, making this the easiest and most comfortable design to “plug in” on the market.

                The punchy slap sounds and driving walking lines are among the most important trademarks of this style of rock'n'roll. The double basses of the GEWA Rockabilly series are visually and tonally precisely tuned to fit into the typical 50s sound and look that fans of the typical American hairdos and pettycoats love so much. With the optional pickups, they are stage-ready at any time and, of course, every single bass is made ready to play in the GEWA master workshops before delivery so that you can start rocking right away.

                High-quality instruments are and always have been our mission. But they must also be affordable and accessible to all. And of course the same goes for bags and cases that the instruments are entrusted to. GEWA German Engineered products are 100% conceptualised and designed by our experts in Germany. Know-how, experience and a constantly open ear for the needs of musicians characterise the work of the development teams. In cooperation with partner and GEWA-owned production facilities all over the world, ideas are turned into products. These locations enable us to use production techniques that are not available in this form elsewhere. Our specialists regularly visit all the production sites to train the staff and ensure that all aspects of production are in line with our expectations. This enables us to guarantee a reasonable price at a consistently high production quality. But that is not quite enough for us. That's why every single product is put through its paces again in our service workshops before delivery. Only in this way can we be sure that GEWA German Engineered is always the right choice.
