## About

As a teenager at school, I was the kid other students approached about issues with their phone or laptop. I was the go-to guy for fixing resolving any technical problems in school and also family.

Today, not much has changed. I’m still the first point of call for technical issues. The difference is I now also develop programs with simple codes to help people in their life.

Apart from that, I was a import & export manager, specialising in the sale of die-making materials. Over the course of 3 and half years in this sphere, I have built a large network of contacts with suppliers and customers across Europe. I also lead a team of five sales staff and source new materials across Europe. During my time in this role, I have growth profits %30 sales in Europe and Africa.

But after spending a few years in a managerial position, I found my true purpose in this life. Programs that will make their work easier with small codes that can help people in all areas of their lives… So, now I’m a Front-End Devepoler.

If you want to know more about me, send me a message or contact with to me for any platform.
