**<h1 align="center">~ Oreo Truffles ~</h1>**

<em> These Oreo Truffles are about as no-fuss as a dessert can be! They're basically a cheater truffle. To make them all you do is stir together finely crushed Oreo crumbs, cream cheese, and vanilla extract until combined, then use a small cookie scoop to scoop balls of the mixture and freeze until firm, around 30 minutes or so. Once firm, dunk them in melted chocolate (we mix ours with coconut oil), let them harden and...you're done!\*

**<u><h2>Directions</h2></ins>**</u>

- **Step 1**

  Use a food processor to crush cookies into fine crumbs.

- **Step 2**

  Add all but 2 tablespoons crushed cookies to a medium bowl. Add cream cheese and vanilla and stir until evenly combined.

- **Step 3**

  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Using a small cookie scoop, form mixture into small balls. Place on prepared baking sheet and freeze until slightly hardened, about 30 minutes.

- **Step 4**

  A few minutes before taking the frozen balls out of the freezer, **melt the white chocolate and coconut oil:** Add the white chocolate and coconut oil to a microwavable bowl, and microwave for 1 minute. Give it a stir. It may be melted at this point, if not, return to microwave in 30-second intervals.

- **Step 5**

  Dip the frozen balls in melted white chocolate/coconut oil until coated, and return to baking sheet. Drizzle with semisweet chocolate. Freeze until chocolate hardens, about 15 minutes.
